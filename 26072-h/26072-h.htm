<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> Author of this very practical treatise
on Scotch Loch-Fishing desires chiefly
that it may be of use to all who read it.
He does not pretend to have written
anything new, but to have attempted to
put what he has to say in as readable
a form as possible. Everything in the
way of the history and habits of fish
has been studiously avoided, and technicalities
have been used as sparingly as
possible. The writing of this book has
afforded him much pleasure in his leisure
moments, and that pleasure would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
much increased if he knew that the perusal
of it would create any bond of sympathy
between himself and the angling
community in general. This edition is
interleaved with blank sheets for the
reader's notes. The Author need hardly
say that any suggestions addressed to
the care of the publishers, will meet with
consideration in a future edition.</p>

<h1>SCOTCH LOCH-FISHING.</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>INTRODUCTORY.</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We</span> do not pretend to write or enlarge upon
a new subject. Much has been said
and written&mdash;and well said and written too&mdash;on
the art of fishing; but loch-fishing <i>per se</i>
has been rather looked upon as a second-rate
performance, and to dispel this idea is one of
the objects for which this present treatise has
been written. Far be it from us to say anything
against fishing, lawfully practised in any
form; but many pent up in our large towns will
bear us out when we say that, on the whole, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
day's loch-fishing is the most convenient. One
great matter is, that the loch-fisher is dependent
on nothing but enough wind to "curl" the
water,&mdash;and on a large loch it is very seldom
that a dead calm prevails all day,&mdash;and can
make his arrangements for a day, weeks beforehand;
whereas the stream-fisher is dependent
for a good take on the state of the water: and
however pleasant and easy it may be for one
living near the banks of a good trout stream or
river, it is quite another matter to arrange for
a day's river-fishing, if one is looking forward
to a holiday at a date some weeks ahead. Providence
may favour the expectant angler with
a "good" day, and the water in order; but experience
has taught most of us that the "good"
days are in the minority, and that, as is the
case with our rapid running streams,&mdash;such as
many of our northern streams are,&mdash;the water
is either too large or too small, unless, as previously
remarked, you live near at hand, and can
catch it at its best.</p>

<p>A common belief in regard to loch-fishing is,
that the tyro and the experienced angler have
nearly the same chance in fishing,&mdash;the one
from the stern and the other from the bow of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the same boat. Of all the absurd beliefs as
to loch-fishing, this is one of the most absurd.
Try it. Give the tyro either end of the boat
he likes; give him a cast of any flies he may
fancy, or even a cast similar to those which a
"crack" may be using; and if he catches one
for every three the other has, he may consider
himself very lucky. Of course there are lochs
where the fish are not abundant, and a beginner
may come across as many as an older fisher;
but we speak of lochs where there are fish to
be caught, and where each has a fair chance.</p>

<p>Again, it is said that the boatman has as
much to do with catching trout in a loch as
the angler. Well, we don't deny that. In an
untried loch it is necessary to have the guidance
of a good boatman; but the same argument
holds good as to stream-fishing. There
are "pools and pools," and the experienced
loch-fisher can "spot" a bay or promontory,
where trout are likely to be lying, with as
much certainty as his brother angler can calculate
on the lie of fish in a stream. Then
there are objections to loch-fishing on the score
of expense. These we are not prepared to refute;
for there is no doubt whatever that loch-fishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
means money. But what has made it
so? The same reason that makes all other
things of more or less value&mdash;the common law
of supply and demand. Time was, and that
not so long ago, when a boatman who used to
get 3s., or at most 4s. a-day, now gets his 5s.
or 6s., and even at the latter figure does not
think himself too well paid. In the extreme
north, however, it is still possible to get a good
man for 3s. a-day; and we know of nothing
more enjoyable than a fortnight's loch-fishing
amidst magnificent scenery in some of our
northern counties. The expense of getting
there will always be a serious matter; but
once there, the fishing in itself is not dear.
The boat is usually got for nothing; the right
of fishing, so far at least as trout are concerned,
is free; and the man's wage and lunch
are decidedly cheap. But for a single day on
some of our nearer lochs,&mdash;such as Loch Leven,
Loch Ard, or Loch Lomond,&mdash;the expenses <i>are</i>
heavy, and the angler must always be the best
judge as to the likelihood of the "game being
worth the candle."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>EQUIPMENT.</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">This</span> will be a short chapter, as tastes differ
so very much, that many things we might
say would most probably be disregarded. But
as to some matters, there can only be one
opinion. Do not fish in <i>light-coloured</i> clothes;
and, should the weather be wet, do not wear
a white macintosh coat. We believe that the
eyesight of a fish is the keenest sense which
it possesses; and, more especially should the
day be clear and fine, there is no doubt that
an unusual white object within range of its
vision will make a fish, which might otherwise
have taken the fly, turn tail and flee. A good
deal of what we hear spoken of as fish "rising
short," proceeds from this cause. No doubt
they rise short sometimes on seeing the angler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
himself, but he is much less likely to attract
notice if clad in dark-hued clothing. We
know of nothing better for a fishing rig-out
than a suit made from dark Harris tweed&mdash;it
will almost last a lifetime, and is a warm and
comfortable wear. Thus you will need a dark
macintosh and leggings; and a common sou'wester
is, when needed, a very useful head-gear.
A pair of cloth-lined india-rubber gloves
will be found desirable in early spring, when
it is quite possible that the temperature may
be low enough for snow. A pair of stout
lacing boots, made with uppers reaching well
up the leg, will be found best, as they protect
the feet from getting damp when going into
or leaving a boat, even though one should need
to step into the water; and if your waterproof
coat is long, as it should be, the necessity of
wearing leggings on a wet day is obviated.
Lastly, <i>by all means keep the body warm</i>, and
remember that the more careful you are of
yourself, even at the risk of being thought
"old wifish," you will, humanly speaking, be
enabled to enjoy the sport to a greater age
than you might otherwise do.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>TACKLE AND ACCESSORIES.</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">As</span> this is likely to be one of the most important
chapters in the book, the reader
must forgive us if we are particular&mdash;even to
a fault&mdash;in describing some of the necessaries
towards the full enjoyment of the pleasures of
loch-fishing. So much depends on our being
comfortable in our enjoyments, that we have,
perhaps, erred on the side of luxuriance; but
to those anglers who think so, there is nothing
easier than their leaving out what they think
superfluous.</p>

<p><i>Creel, or Fishing-Bag.</i>&mdash;The creel for loch-fishing
should be of the largest size made, so
as to serve for all kinds of fish; and as the
angler is always in a boat, the difference of
room occupied is of very little moment. Besides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
it accommodates his tackle and lunch,
and even waterproofs, though the latter are
better to be strapped on outside. These creels
are neatest when made in French basket-work;
and even the lightest of them, with ordinary
care, will last many years, more especially if
the edges and bottom are leather-bound. Almost
any tackle-shop will supply them plain,
or bound with leather, as desired. Brass hinges
and hasp will also be found great improvements.
The fishing-bag is of somewhat recent
development, and is very convenient; but the
objection to it is that, unless the waterproof
cloth with which it is lined be carefully
washed after each day's fishing, a nasty smell
is apt to be contracted and retained. Though
we use the bag often ourselves, we incline for
many reasons to the old-fashioned creel. Many
loch-fishers carry along with them a square
basket about 16 in. &times; 8 broad &times; 10 deep, which
they use for carrying their tackle and lunch,
thus leaving the creel or fishing-bag free for
fish alone. This is a capital plan, the only
objection being that it makes another article
to carry. As to its usefulness there can be
no doubt, as nothing is more undesirable than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
having tackle and fish in one basket or bag,
even though you should have something between.
Some anglers go the length of a luncheon-basket,
but this savours so much of the
picnic that we don't approve of it.</p>

<p><i>Landing-Net and Gaff.</i>&mdash;These may be got
at any tackle shop, the only care to be exercised
being in the selection of a good long
handle, and in seeing that the net be made
of twine which resists the catching of hooks,
and that it be of a size capable of landing a
large fish, as the gaff leaves an ugly mark,
and should only be used when actually necessary.
The screw of the net-hoop and of the
gaff will suit the same handle.</p>

<p><i>Fishing-Rods.</i>&mdash;For loch-fishing, it is desirable
to use a rod not less than 14 feet in
length, if fishing for ordinary yellow trout; but
if for sea trout, and the chance of "a fish" <i>par
excellence</i>, then the rod should be a couple of
feet longer. The angler will find that it is
better to have both rods with him&mdash;the spare
one being handy in case of calamity&mdash;as the
extra trouble of carrying is very slight: rods
and landing-net handle can be easily tied up together
with small leather straps. Do not have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
a rod that bends too freely&mdash;rather err on the
other side; because in loch-fishing you have
generally wind enough to carry your flies
out, and if you do get a 3 or 4 pounder, the
advantage of a fairly stiff rod is apparent.
We prefer rods in three pieces&mdash;no hollow-butts&mdash;and
made of greenheart throughout.
The first cost is more than for rods whose
various parts are made of different woods, but
the greenheart is the cheapest rod in the end.
With the minimum of care, a greenheart never
gets out of order; and a good rod of this
description will be as straight at the end of
a season as at the beginning. Avoid all
fancy rods, and do not be beguiled into buying
them.</p>

<p><i>Reels and Lines.</i>&mdash;Always carry a couple of
reels with you, the smaller with 60 yards of
fine line, and the larger with not less than 100
yards of grilse line. Silk-and-hair lines are
not very expensive, and with a little care will
last a long time. They will be found the most
satisfactory for all kinds of fly-work. The
reels which we consider best are made of
bronzed metal and vulcanite: they are light,
and stand a lot of wear. When buying your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
rods, get the reels fitted to them, and see that
the fit is sufficiently tight, as nothing is more
annoying than to find the ferrules loosening
their hold of the reel, and that, perhaps, at a
most critical moment. Should the reels referred
to not be heavy enough to balance the
rods properly&mdash;and this is a matter of great
importance&mdash;it may be as well to take reels
made entirely of bronzed metal.</p>

<p><i>Fly-Book.</i>&mdash;We are not much in favour of
fly-books. They are a great temptation to
keeping a large stock of flies; and in the following
chapter we will show that the fewer
flies one possesses the better. A serious objection
to a fly-book is, that the flies get crushed
in it, and we consider a box a better receptacle;
but if the angler will have a fly-book,
one of moderate size&mdash;rather to the big size
if anything&mdash;made of pig-skin leather, and
well provided with pouches for holding casting-lines,
as well as the usual receptacles for flies,
will be found best. These books are to be had
in great variety at any wholesale tackle warehouse;
and taste goes a long way in non-essentials.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond the articles mentioned, the angler
should always have at hand the following:&mdash;</p>

<ul><li>Spring balance, weighing up to 20 lb.</li>
<li>Small screw-driver.</li>
<li>Small gimlet.</li>
<li>Small bottle clockmaker's oil.</li>
<li>Bottle varnish.</li>
<li>Carriage-lamp, and candles to fit, for travelling.</li>
<li>Two packs playing-cards.</li>
<li>Good-sized flask.</li>
<li>Flat glass or horn drinking-cup.</li>
<li>Pocket-scissors. The kind that shut up will be found very useful.</li>
<li>Corkscrew.</li>
<li>Hank of medium gut for emergencies.</li>
<li>Fine silk thread and resin.</li>
<li>Some common thin twine for tying joints of rod together.</li>
<li>Also articles named in Chapter V., p. 21, under "Trolling-Tackle and Lures."</li></ul>

<p>Many of these things may be considered
quite <i>de trop</i>; but the longer one fishes, the
more one finds out that the little luxuries
give a vast amount of enjoyment for the small
amount of foresight required to have them at
hand when wanted.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>FLIES AND CASTING-LINES.</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Flies</span>.&mdash;Here we shall no doubt come into
conflict with many opinions, and most
probably meet with the most criticism. However,
as all we have written, and mean to
write, is the result of actual experience, we
may be pardoned for being somewhat dogmatic
on the subject in hand. In the first place,
don't keep a large stock of flies. If going for
a day's fishing, buy as many as you think
you'll need, and <i>no more</i>. Buy them of different
sizes; and if you get a few each time you
go for an outing, you will be astonished how
soon a spare stock accumulates. Ascertain
carefully beforehand the <i>size</i> suitable to the
loch&mdash;the <i>kinds</i> are not of so much importance&mdash;and
once you have made up a cast, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
which operation there is no harm in taking
your boatman's suggestions, <i>do not change</i>, unless
it be to put on a smaller or larger size
according to the wind, or unless it is conclusively
proved that other flies are raising trout
when yours cannot. Of course, if you are
going for a fortnight's fishing, you will require
to lay in a fair stock; but even then get as few
as you think you can possibly do with. Do
not run any risk of running short, and do not
place yourself in the position of needing to use
old casts: that is poor economy in the long-run.
The following is, we think, a fair list for a fortnight's
sport in an out-of-the-way place:&mdash;</p>

<table class="lftb" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="center" style="white-space: nowrap;">Half-dozen</td><td class="td3">harelugs.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="center">"</td><td class="td3">red and teal.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="center">"</td><td class="td3">orange and mallard.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="center">"</td><td class="td3">green and woodcock.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="center">"</td><td class="td3">black spiders with red tips, commonly called "Zulus."</td></tr>
<tr><td class="center">"</td><td class="td3">red spiders, hackle taken well down the hook.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="center">"</td><td class="td3">March Browns, which, though supposed to come out in March, are really capital flies at any time.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="center">"</td><td class="td3">yellow body with cinnamon wings and golden-pheasant tip.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="center">"</td><td class="td3">dark harelug body, mallard wing and red tip. This is a splendid spring fly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></td></tr>
</table>

<p class="clr">These we would get dressed on Loch Leven
size&mdash;any fly-dresser knows what that means;
but perhaps the better way would be to get a
quarter dozen of each dressed on that size, and a
quarter dozen of each on a hook two sizes larger.
The patterns in a tackle-maker's book are endless,
but for the most part are modifications or
combinations of the flies we have named; and
the angler will soon discover for himself that
flies and old half-used casts, and often casts made
up in the humour of the moment, and never
used at all, accumulate upon him so rapidly
that he is glad to find some enthusiastic boatman
to bestow them upon. It is needless to
add, that a gift of this kind is usually very
much appreciated by the recipient. Tinsel is
a very useful adjunct to a fly, and should always
be employed in those used in loch-fishing.
If variety is wanted in colouring, the
least tip of Berlin or pig's wool of the desired
shade will be found very effective. Get your
flies dressed on Limerick-bend hooks, as the
iron, should it chance not to be the best tempered
in the world, is not so liable to snap as
the round bend. The wings of the fly should
be dressed so as to be distinctly apart both in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the water and out of it, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="bk1" style="width: 184px;">
<img src="images/001.png" width="184" height="103" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="noin">It gives the fly a much more life-like appearance,
and makes it swim better in the water.
When you give orders for flies, see that they
are dressed up to your instructions, as it is
quite certain you will fish with much more
confidence when you have faith in what you
are using. Do not have them dressed on too
fine gut, as they are apt to get twisted round
the casting-line (usually called "riding the
line"), and put you to the trouble of straightening
them out every few minutes. These remarks
may seem trifling; but trifles are very irritating
in most pursuits, and the gentle art is no
exception. Flies suitable for salmon and sea-trout
fishing on almost any loch will be supplied
at any shop in the trade on asking for
Loch Lomond patterns. These patterns are
well-known, and are without exception as fine
flies as one could wish for. They are usually
made very full in the body, and dressed with
heron's hackle. The varieties are red and teal,
green and teal, orange and mallard, or turkey,
and a few variations of these,&mdash;sometimes a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
yellow tip to the red and green bodies, or a
red tip to the yellow; but a cast composed of
red or green and teal with orange and mallard
is unsurpassable. For this class of fishing,
the flies should be dressed with loops, and
the bob should be fixed to the casting-line
by means of a small strand of gut. Two
flies on a cast are quite sufficient when big
fish are expected. We can hardly advise the
angler to try fly-dressing on his own account.
It is hardly worth his while, as flies are to
be had very reasonably from any respectable
tackle-maker; and they are much better
dressed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred
than any amateur performance.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p><i>Casting-Lines.</i>&mdash;Provide yourself with half
a dozen each, of different thickness&mdash;that is,
fine, medium, and stout, the latter for salmon
and sea-trout fishing. That quantity should
suffice for a fortnight's outing, even making
allowance for breakage, and leave you some
over for another time: but in this matter it is
better to run no risk of being short. The gut
should be stained a light tea colour, or the
faintest blue: it can be bought so. There is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
no occasion for them being more than three
yards long, as we cannot advocate fishing with
more than three flies at a time. If three flies
are properly placed on a line, and the line be
properly handled in the casting, they will cover
as much water as any number of flies. Besides,
there is far less chance of a "fankle," to use a
most expressive Scotch word, than when four
or more flies are used. In this, however,
<i>chacun &agrave; son go&ucirc;t</i>,&mdash;we are only giving an
opinion after trying both ways.</p>

<p>In making up a cast of flies, <i>have no loops</i>
of any kind, excepting the one by which the
cast is attached to your silk-and-hair line. The
water-knot is so simple and neat, that it is the
best for the purpose of fixing on the tail-fly,
which, by the way, should be the heaviest of
those you are about to use, if there is any
difference between them. In case our readers
don't know the water-knot, we give an illustration
which explains itself&mdash;</p>

<div class="bk1" style="width: 635px;">
<img src="images/002.png" width="635" height="76" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="noin">The loops are pulled tight, and then the fly
and the line are drawn in opposite directions,
the result being that the knots formed by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
loops meet and make a firm, and at the same
time an almost imperceptible, joining. You
then clip off any ends that may remain. So
much for the tail fly. The putting on of the
other two is simplicity itself. You take the
strand of gut on which the next fly you purpose
affixing is dressed, and laying it along the
main line, <i>taking care to have the hook lying in
the reverse direction from the tail fly</i>, you tie
it into the line a yard from the fly already
attached. In tying it in, leave the hook hanging
about two and a half inches from the line.
The third, or "bob" fly, is attached in like
manner, and thus your cast of flies is completed.
The only objection to this method of
making up a cast is, that once the middle and
bob flies are tied in, they cannot be used again.
This is quite true; but the keen angler will
submit to the little extra expense on this score
for the gratification which the sight of a really
neat cast will afford him. The system of suspending
hooks by loops, especially when using
fine tackle, is almost entirely exploded. We
should have said that previous to use, all gut
should be soaked, and the longer the better.
It is a good plan to let it soak over night, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
make up your cast in the morning. When gut
is thus thoroughly wet, it is wonderful how
easy it is of manipulation. On the other hand,
dry gut is very brittle, and will break on the
slightest provocation. Fix the cast and silk-and-hair
line together, having previously made
a single knot on the end of the latter, as illustrated
below&mdash;</p>

<div class="bk1" style="width: 618px;">
<img src="images/003.png" width="618" height="49" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="noin">It is prudent to have a second cast ready in
case of breakage, as nothing is more annoying
than losing time making up one in the boat,
and that most probably when the trout are
rising. Experience is a great teacher; and it
is wonderful how soon the angler learns the
value of every moment, and seeks beforehand,
so far as human foresight can go, to provide
for all contingencies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>TROLLING-TACKLE AND LURES.</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Do</span> not troll at all if you can get fishing
with the fly; and under no circumstances
troll for trout in the very early part of the
season, when they are more or less in a "kelty"
state, and take an artificial or other minnow
very keenly. True, you may catch fish, but it
is a most unsportsmanlike proceeding to take
fish not in fair condition; and if you, sir, who
read this book, are not a sportsman, you had
better stop here, for it was compiled by a
sportsman for sportsmen. There are some
miserable "pot-hunters" who want to kill anything
that swims&mdash;be it clean or unclean; but
with them we have nothing whatever to do.
But fair trolling is quite legitimate, and in
many cases it is absolutely imperative to troll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
if a basket is to be made at all. Some days
the fly is of no use&mdash;either owing to a calm, or
to a bright sky; and a well-managed trolling-line
or two is then the only resort, unless one
stops fishing altogether. And if big trout and
<i>ferox</i> are wanted, nothing succeeds&mdash;indeed
nothing <i>will</i> succeed, except very occasionally&mdash;but
trolling, either with artificial or natural
bait. So to be complete you must have the
requisite tackle, and we will tell you what is
necessary, both for small and large fish, in as
few words as we possibly can. A <span class="smcapl">ROD</span> specially
adapted for trolling is almost a necessity, as it
is a great strain upon an ordinary fly-rod to
have the weight of 30 or 40 yards of line
upon it: even a good rod is apt to get an ugly
bend from such treatment. The rod for trolling
need not be long&mdash;12 to 14 feet is quite sufficient&mdash;but
it must be stiff; and we consider
that the rings through which the line is led
ought to be large and fixed&mdash;that is, standing
out permanently from the wood, called by the
trade upright rings. A spare top will be supplied
along with it. The <span class="smcapl">REEL</span> should be of
the largest description, and may be got as
strong as possible, lightness being no recommendation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to one used exclusively for trolling.
The <span class="smcapl">LINE</span> ought to be at least 100 yards long&mdash;120
for choice&mdash;and this suffices for any kind
of fish. The material best adapted for trolling
is oiled silk-and-hair. There is a kind of line,
made in America, we believe, which is admirably
adapted for the purpose. It is strong as
wire-rope, and does not "kink" under any circumstances&mdash;which
latter is a consideration, as
sometimes a paltry trout may come on, and you
have only to haul him in hand-over-hand without
running the risk of your line getting into
a mess. This saves the trouble and waste of
time in reeling up many yards of line every
time a "smout" comes on. The line to which
we refer is somewhat expensive, but will be
found to be cheap in the long-run. An ordinary
silk-and-hair line does well enough, but
is apt to twist sadly if the minnow is not spinning
properly, besides the trouble it entails
after a day's fishing of laying out two or three
score yards for drying. The troller will require
to provide himself with <span class="smcapl">MINNOW TRACES</span>. These
do not require to be more than two yards in
length, but in ordering them take care that the
swivels are sufficiently large to insure the minnow&mdash;natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
or artificial&mdash;spinning nicely.
The angler can easily procure swivels and make
traces for himself; but he will find in this, as in
most things connected with fishing, that he cannot
compete with the tackle-maker, so we advise
him to get them made up at a good warehouse.
Retail tackle-makers charge long prices, but in
most large towns there are warehouses which are
specially suited for a customer trade, thus saving
the user a long intermediate profit. This is as
it should be. The thickness of the gut used
for trolling should of course be regulated, as
in fly-fishing, by the size of fish you expect
to catch, and a few traces made of gimp
for pike and <i>ferox</i> should always be in the
troller's stock. By the way, and in case we forget
to mention it afterwards, always be provided
with some split swan shot, to be used in case of
a very clear day, when it is desirable to sink
line and minnow below the surface. Also be
provided with tackle&mdash;some mounted on gut
and some on gimp&mdash;for spinning natural minnow;
and we know of none better or more
deadly for this purpose than that of which an
illustration is given on next page. It is very
simple, and seldom misses anything.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<div class="bk1" style="width: 628px;">
<img src="images/004.png" width="628" height="57" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The large hook is put in at the mouth of the
minnow, and the point brought out at a little
above the tail&mdash;thus giving the minnow the
proper curve for spinning. One of the smaller
hooks is put through <i>both</i> lips of the lure, to
close the mouth and to keep the bait in proper
position, while the other is left to spin. Some
advocate the use of par-tail as a spinning
bait; but as it is not right to kill par at all,
we omit any directions for its use. We have
drifted into the subject of <span class="smcapl">LURES</span> almost unconsciously.
If you wish to use natural minnows,
see that they are neither too large nor
too small&mdash;about two inches long is a good
size&mdash;and that the belly is silvery. It is
better to instruct your boatman to have a
supply ready against your arrival at the loch,
as sometimes it is as difficult to catch minnows
as to catch any other fish. However, we believe
that the want of them is so well supplied by
the phantom minnow, that little or no harm
is done though they are not to be had. And
when the handling and bother of using live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
bait is taken into consideration, we think
that most folks will prefer the artificial lure.
The phantom we consider the very best of
all the imitations; and the troller should have
them in different colours and sizes, from Nos.
1 to 7. The hooks attached to the larger sizes
should be mounted on gimp, as in trolling for
large fish&mdash;and especially for <i>salmo ferox</i>&mdash;no
risk should be run of the mountings giving way.
Tin boxes, divided into compartments, for holding
the minnows, are very convenient, and are
to be had at most tackle shops. A spoon-bait
is also a splendid deception, and should not
be awanting. A tackle-maker's catalogue will
tell the reader of many other "spinners;" but
if he cannot catch fish of all kinds with either
a natural or phantom minnow or a spoon, it is
not the fault of the lure; and he may try anything
else he fancies, and come no better speed.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>DUTIES OF BOATMAN.</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Very</span> little requires to be said in this
chapter regarding boatmen, as when the
angler gets into the habit of frequenting certain
lochs, he soon finds out for himself the
steady reliable men in the neighbourhood, and
can generally engage one of them beforehand
by writing to the hotel at which he means to
put up. But in going to a new fishing-ground,
he is better to leave himself in the hands of
the landlord of the hotel, and if not satisfied
with his first day's experience of the man who
accompanied him, let him change. A good
boatman is a treasure; and though we are
decidedly against the system of "tipping" indiscriminately,
we say, when you get a good
man, pay him liberally. We know of some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
men with whom it is a pleasure to be out all
day, and whose company, in its own way, is
most enjoyable. Keen sportsmen these are,
and the capture or loss of a fish is a source of
true pleasure or pain. Other men one comes
across seem but to row the boat, and nothing
more; and an unproductive day in such company
is something to be looked back upon with
horror. The leading qualification of a boatman
of the right sort is a strong sympathy with the
angler, which enables him almost instinctively
to help the angler to cover every inch of likely
water with his flies, and makes him experience
the sensation of expecting a rise every cast; in
other words, he almost puts the fly into the
fish's mouth. With such a man, instructions
regarding the management of the boat are
superfluous; but as it often happens that you
do not get a first-rate hand, you have to take
matters into your own hands to some extent;
and we shall give you a few hints as to what
is best to be done under such circumstances.
It is hardly to be supposed that your man is
in ignorance of the best ground, either from
experience or hearsay, and it is only after you
get there that our instructions can possibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
come into operation. If you are obliged to
take a perfect greenhorn, we know of no other
course than to order him to keep in the wake
of some other boat, but that at such a distance
as not to be offensive. (See next chapter on
the "Etiquette of Loch-fishing.") But let us
assume that you get on to ground where fish
are: the first point is to see that everything
is in order, all unnecessary articles put out
of the way, and the landing-net and gaff conveniently
at hand. We ought to have said
that a large stone in the bow is useful, not
only to balance the boat and make her drift
better, but also as a weight to which a rope
may be attached, and thus let over the side
to the depth of a few feet, to prevent her
drifting too rapidly should there happen to
be a heavy breeze on. The next thing is to
get the boat properly broadside to the wind,
so that you may have next to no trouble in
casting. Should a fish be hooked, see that the
man keeps working the boat in such a manner
that the fish cannot possibly get underneath:
a single stroke of the oar in the proper direction
is generally all that is necessary. You
must also judge from the size of the fish, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the length and strength of your tackle, whether
it is expedient that the man should follow the
fish if he makes a very long run. If your line
happens to be short&mdash;which it will not be, if
you have followed the instructions given in
Chapter III.&mdash;you need not be surprised if you
find nothing left but your rod and reel, your
line, and mayhap a "half-croon flee" flying
about the loch in charge of a fish. The management
of the landing-net or gaff is another
serious matter. If the fish be small, tell the man
to have the net ready, and "run it in;" but if
it is a good-sized fish, you must tell him not to
put the net near till he gets the word from you.
Many a time we have suppressed an exclamation&mdash;the
reverse of a blessing&mdash;when we have
seen the hoop of the landing-net strike the fish,
and were in suspense for a second or two as to
whether he was on or off. If the gaff is necessary,
it is almost as well to let your man hold
the rod after you have tired the fish thoroughly,
and gaff him yourself. But if you think it unadvisable
to part with the rod, send the man to
the other end of the boat from yourself, and
then lead the fish near him, so that he may
have a fair chance. He must put the gaff <i>over</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the fish till the point is in a line with its
broadside, and then with a sudden <i>jerk</i> sink
the steel into, or even through, the animal,
and lift him over the gunwale with all possible
speed. A sharp blow or two on the snout will
deprive the fish of life. Always kill your fish,&mdash;big
or small,&mdash;as nothing ought to be more
repulsive to a true sportsman than to see or
hear any animal he has captured dying by
inches.</p>

<p>It is perhaps needless to say that in the
matter of lunch and drink, due consideration
should always be paid to your boatman's wants;
indeed if he has had a hard time of it rowing
against a stiff breeze, nothing is lost by landing
at mid-day and letting him enjoy half an hour's
rest and a smoke after he has refreshed his
inner man. Sometimes&mdash;such as in a club
competition&mdash;such luxuries must be denied;
but even then he can put you on to a square
drift, and enjoy his lunch and smoke while you
are fishing; and you, on the other hand, can
take yours when he is changing ground. These
remarks may seem trifling; but we only give
you our experience, when we say that on some
lochs where good boatmen are not plentiful, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
angler who has shown most kindness and consideration
on past occasions is never much put
about for want of a man, even in a busy season.
And we have known, when every regular boatman
was engaged, that there was generally a
boatman's "friend" in the neighbourhood who
was pressed into our service, and that often at
a few minutes' notice.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<small>ETIQUETTE OF LOCH-FISHING.</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Politeness</span> is politeness all the world
over, and in loch-fishing it is particularly
to be practised. The gentle art is peculiarly
adapted for gentlemen,&mdash;using the word in
its truest sense,&mdash;and the true angler will never
be mistaken for anything else. In the Club to
which we have the honour to belong, there are
certain rules which would commend themselves
naturally to any one of us; but in order that
these may be clear and well defined, they are
circulated annually, and are in themselves so
admirable that we cannot do better than quote
them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"1. No boat shall be entitled to take position in
front of any other boat which shall have already begun
drifting, at a less distance than three hundred yards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"2. Any competitor intending to drift a bay already
in possession of another competitor shall be obliged to
take position behind, or on the outside of and in a line
with the latter, but at such a distance as not to interfere
with the boat first in possession of the drift.</p>

<p>"3. In cases where boats are changing water, it
shall not be admissible for any boat so doing to go
between the shore and any other boat drifting close
thereon."</p></div>

<p>These rules, as may be inferred, refer to club
competitions in particular, but they are made
the standard upon all occasions where there is
any chance of their becoming applicable. So
much indeed have we got into the way of regarding
these rules,&mdash;strict as they are,&mdash;that we
observe them even when meeting with strangers
on any loch in any part of the kingdom. And
pay special attention, if you happen to be trolling
in the neighbourhood, never to interfere
with the drift on which a fly-fisher is engaged.
Nothing is more unbecoming, as it disturbs the
water which is his by right, if he has begun to
drift; and it is an unwritten rule that the fly-fisher
should generally be allowed the first of
the ground, as his style of fishing does not
make the same commotion as a trolling boat
and tackle do. Very few of us but have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
experienced the annoyance of a minnow-boat
crossing our drift when we were fly-fishing;
and though we had no redress, and could make
no remarks without lowering ourselves to the
level of our offenders, we have, like the nigger's
parrot, "thought a mighty lot." Do not hesitate
to put yourself out of your way to help a
neighbour in distress. He may have hooked a
large fish and be unprovided with a gaff: if you
have one let him have it instantly, taking his
directions from which side you are to approach
him; and never let the loss of a few minutes,
more or less, deter you from following the
golden rule of doing to him as you would expect
him to do to you were you similarly placed.
And, as it sometimes happens where boats are
scarce and anglers many, when you are in the
same boat with a stranger, see that you confine
yourself strictly to your own share of the water,
not making casts which endanger "fankling"
for the mere sake of covering a little more
water with your flies. Should you have a fly
that is taking better than any other of your
own or his, offer him one; and in general try to
make the day's fishing one as much for the cultivation
of goodwill and the promotion of good-fellowship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
as for the mere sake of making a
basket. A churlish angler is an unnatural
phenomenon, and, thank Providence! they
seldom turn up. A man who can look upon
the beautiful scenery amid which he takes his
pleasure,&mdash;and there is none finer in the world
than our Scottish lochs and their surroundings,&mdash;and
not feel grateful to the Giver of all good,
and at peace with all mankind, ought to burn
his rod, singe his flies, and only associate with
men like himself.</p>

<p>If the introduction of this chapter into our
book will have the effect of creating a better
understanding on the etiquette of loch-fishing
between brothers of the angle, the object for
which it was written will have been accomplished&mdash;and,
let us hope, a large amount of
goodwill thereby promoted.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>CASTING AND STRIKING.</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We</span> shall treat this subject under two
aspects: first, if you have the whole
boat to yourself; and second, if it is being
shared by some one else.</p>

<p>If you have a boat to yourself, stand as near
the centre of it as you possibly can without
interfering with the boatman in rowing, and
cover every inch of the water in front of you
and as far to the sides as the wind will permit.
Always be careful how you cast&mdash;that
is, every time you throw your flies see that
they land lightly on the water, as no one can
expect to raise fish if any splash is made by
either line or flies. Fine casting is not quite
so essential, of course, when a fair breeze is
blowing; but if the wind be light, then the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
difference between a well-thrown fly and the
reverse is very apparent. After you have made
a satisfactory cast, draw the line slowly to you
by raising the point of the rod, taking care to
keep the line as taut as possible. Also see
that your bob-fly is tripping on the surface,
as we consider that a well-managed "bob" is
the most life-like of the whole lot. Do not fish
with too long a line, unless, indeed, on an exceptional
occasion, when you wish to reach the lie
of a feeding fish. It is difficult to define a long
line, but a good general rule is that it should
never be longer than when you have the consciousness
that, if a fish should rise, you have
him at a fair and instantaneous striking distance.
Remember that the time the flies first
touch the water after each cast is the most
deadly; therefore, cast often.</p>

<p>If you have only the share of a boat, the rule
is that one man takes the stern up till lunch,
and the other after it. For ourselves, we have
a preference for the bow, and we generally find
that most anglers prefer the luxury of the stern;
so when both parties are pleased, there is no occasion
for changing at all. The most important
thing to bear in mind when you have a companion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
is, as we said in last chapter, to confine
yourself to your own water. If the left-hand
cast is the one proper to your end of the boat,
cast as much to your right hand as you can
without infringing on your neighbour's share of
the water: all the water to your left hand is
of course yours. The same remarks apply <i>vice
versa</i>. <i>Never stop casting</i> so long as you are on
fishable ground, for you know not the moment
a good fish may rise. Certain it is that unless
you keep your flies constantly going, you cannot
expect to have the same basket as the angler
who does. Keep your eyes on your flies in a
general way, and do not let your attention be
distracted so long as they are in the water.
Every angler has experienced the annoyance of
missing fish when looking elsewhere for a single
moment&mdash;either at another boat, or at a fish
"rising to itself," or at the sky, or at something
else. When the eyes were turned to the point
from which they should not have been diverted,
they were just in time to see the water swirl,
and the hand gave a futile strike at what
had disappeared a second before. Perhaps we
should have said at the beginning of this chapter
to place implicit faith in the flies with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
which you are fishing. Nothing is more ridiculous
than whipping the water with a cast, of
the suitableness of which you have any doubt;
and to guard against any such chance, study
carefully the state of the weather and the wind.
If very clear, use sombre flies; but if a dark
day, use brighter flies. You will of course regulate
the size according to the breeze, but as a
rule, err on the side of small flies. When you
raise a fish, <i>strike at once</i>. It is quite possible
that by this method you may once in a while
strike the least bit too soon, but it is a safe
plan to go by. There is always a particle of
a moment spent in the tightening of the line;
and by the time the angler sees a fish at his
flies, he may safely conclude that it has already
seized or missed them, and the sooner he ascertains
the true state of matters by striking instantaneously,
the better. If the fish has not
been touched by line or hook, cast gently over
him again: the chances are that there will be
another rise, and, if the fish has been feeding,
every likelihood that the second or even a third
time may be lucky. In striking small fish, the
least tightening of the line is sufficient; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
with large fish, when your tackle and hooks
are strong, strike <i>firmly home</i> to send the steel
well in, right over the barb. Tackle that will
not stand this had better be given away or destroyed,&mdash;the
latter for choice.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>TROLLING.</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Our</span> readers will have guessed, from what
has preceded this chapter, that we don't
believe in trolling if it can be avoided; but still
there are times and occasions on which it must
be practised, and we plead guilty to having
gone in for it oftener than once, when we saw
that fly-fishing was useless. On the other hand,
however, we have set out with a firm determination
to do a fair day's trolling,&mdash;and nothing
but trolling,&mdash;but somehow or another it has
generally ended in fly-fishing when we could,
and trolling as a <i>dernier ressort</i> when we could
not. This, we doubt not, has been the experience
of many of our angling friends to whom
the mere killing of fish is a secondary consideration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
compared with the enjoyment of real
sport. But when trolling is the order of the
day, either from choice or necessity, then this
is the way to go about it. We assume, of
course, that the angler is equipped with tackle
and lines specified in Chapter V., and that he
has a supply also of live minnows with him.
The elaborate tin-cans for holding minnows are
quite unnecessary so far as loch-fishing is concerned;
any ordinary vessel will do well enough
for a day, provided the water is changed now
and again. In trolling, two rods will be found
ample. They should be placed at right angles
to the boat,&mdash;the "thowl-pin," or, if there is not
one near enough the stern, anything (a cheap
gimlet answers admirably) fixed into the gunwale,
being sufficient to keep the rod in position,&mdash;so
that the spinners, of whatever kind
they may be, will be as far apart from each
other as possible. Take care that the butts of
the rods are well at the bottom of the boat, as
we have seen a rod not sufficiently fixed go
overboard before now. A main point in trolling
is to have plenty of line out. There should
never be less than thirty yards out from one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
rod, and not less that forty from the other. By
this means, should a fish not see the first lure,
he may see the second. If trolling with natural
minnow, which is much more apt to get out of
order than artificial ones, see that the bait is intact
and spinning properly. This involves the
trouble of hauling it in for examination now
and then; but it is better to be at that trouble
than be fishing with, mayhap, a mangled lure,
or one that has got out of spinning order, and
more likely to act as a repellent than an attraction
to any fish in the neighbourhood. In
trolling any likely ground, the proper way is
to tell your man to zigzag it, not pulling the
boat in a straight line, but going over the
ground diagonally, and thus covering as much
of it as it is possible to do with a couple score
yards of line behind. The turning of the boat
necessitates a considerable circle being taken
to keep the lures spinning, and so that the
lines do not get mixed up; and your man,
after making the turn, should row in a slightly
slanting direction towards the point from which
he originally started, thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="bk1" style="width: 586px;">
<img src="images/005.png" width="586" height="236" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="noin">and so on, till the chances of raising a fish on
that beat are exhausted.</p>

<p>Should a small fish come on, haul it in hand-over-hand;
and the man must not stop rowing,
as the other minnow is out, and must be kept
spinning. If, however, a fish that needs playing
comes to you, you must seize the rod to
which he has come, and the boatman must
take the other, and wind in as fast as possible.
You should not commence winding in till the
other line is wound up so far as to preclude
the chance of the fish mixing up both lines
together. Barring the risk one runs of a serious
mess, it is not a bad plan to troll from a
reel a cast of larger-sized flies than would be
used in ordinary fly-fishing. This line follows,
of course, in a <i>straight</i> track behind the boat,
and the minnows being considerably to right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and left of it, there is no danger of their getting
mixed so long as the boat is moving; but the
risk is apparent should a fish come to either of
the three lines, and great activity is then necessary
on the part of yourself and boatman to
keep things right. You must keep the fish at
as considerable a distance from the other lines
as you can, and trust a good deal to the chances
of war for the ultimate safety of all. Some
days, even when casting was unproductive, we
have been fortunate in securing fish by trolling
our flies in the manner described. Indeed, unless
the day or the season is decidedly in favour
of trolling minnows, we prefer, if only trolling
two lines, to troll from one of them with the
minnow, and from the other with the fly. This
must always be decided, however, by the judgment
of the angler, and by his surroundings for
the time being. One thing in favour of trolling
with the minnow is, that the best size of fish are
caught by that means. This is not invariably
the case, but it is the rule. And in concluding
this chapter, we must not omit to acknowledge
that we are glad to know that when we are not
so young as we once were, and when the wielding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of a rod all day long shall have come to be
a serious matter, we shall still have the pleasure
of roaming about our lovely lochs&mdash;Highland
or Lowland&mdash;and have the excitement of
landing fish, coupled with our enjoyment of
fresh air and grand scenery. For this reason,
if for no other, cultivate as often as you can,
without entrenching on the nobler pastime of
fly-fishing, the art of trolling&mdash;for we must confess
that there is an art in this as in everything
else; and should my reader be sceptical on the
point, he has only to try conclusions, when he
gets the chance, with some old troller, and he
will be convinced before supper-time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<small>CAPTURE OF FISH.</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Scotch</span> loch-fishing, as usually practised,
only embraces the capture of the <i>salmo</i>
species&mdash;that is, the <i>salmo fario</i>, or common
yellow trout; the <i>salmo trutta</i>, or sea-trout; and
<i>salmo salar</i>, the "fish," as most boatmen call
it, and the noblest game of the finny creation.
Besides these there is, of course, the <i>salmo
ferox</i>; but it is comparatively scarce, and only
worth trolling for in some particular lochs,
where they are known to be more easily come
across than in others. And sometimes when
worthier game is not to be had, we have a
spin for pike, but Mr Jack is as difficult to
catch at times as his more aristocratic comrades.
In most Scotch lochs where any supervision
is exercised at the instance of our local<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
clubs, the extermination of pike is most vigorously
carried on by means of fixed and splash
nets. This, as regards our large lochs, where
there is room for all, we have no hesitation in
saying is a mistake, as it shuts up one means
of enjoying a day's fishing when nothing else
in the way of fish is to be had; and it must
be borne in mind that there are some older
anglers, to whom a whole day's fly-fishing is
a labour, who never object, when trolling, to
come across a pike: and no wonder, for a pike
of 10 lb. and upwards gives some fair play,
though by no means to compare with what a
fish of the <i>salmo</i> tribe of that weight would
give. Then we have perch in abundance, and
splendid eels; but as these need a float and
bait to catch them, we dismiss them as quite
<i>infra dig</i>. True a perch will come at a minnow,
and we have sometimes seen them take
a fly; but they are generally voted a nuisance,
and expelled the boat.</p>

<p>As regards the capture of fish, we shall proceed
to deal with each in order; and at the
outset we remark, that when you have hooked
a fish, it is a safe general rule to waste no
unnecessary time in bringing him to the landing-net<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
or gaff, and thence into the boat.
When playing a fish, never allow the line to
get slack, unless, indeed, when he leaps into
the air,&mdash;then you must give him rope; but so
soon as he gets into his native element, feel
his mouth instantly. Always play your fish
to <i>windward</i> of the boat if there is some one
sharing it with you, as this allows him to go
on casting to leeward. Of course, if you have
the whole boat to yourself, play your fish in
any way that it will be most expeditiously
brought to basket. The angler ought to be
well assured of the strength of his tackle, and
when he has confidence in that, he will soon
learn to judge of the proper strain to which it
may be subjected. In the case of <span class="smcapl">COMMON
YELLOW TROUT</span>, averaging, as most loch trout do,
about three to the pound, there is no occasion
to put off time with any one of them; but in
some lochs, such as Loch Leven, where the
average is fairly one pound, and where two
and three pounders are by no means uncommon,
some care and a little play are absolutely
necessary. But do not, even in such a case,
give him too much of his own way. We can
assure our readers that a three-pound Loch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Leven trout, in good condition, on fine gut
and small irons, gives as nice a piece of play,
and exercise to the eye, hand, and judgment,
as could well be desired.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapl">SEA-TROUT</span> is, for his size, the gamest
of all fish. He is bold as a lion, and fights
harder for his life than a salmon twice his
size. A fish of three pounds will run out a
considerable piece of line, and make a splendid
leap, or series of leaps,&mdash;and then is the trying
time. As often as not, your flies and the fish
part company in the air, and you have to sit
down muttering "curses not loud but deep,"
till an application to the flask soothes your
wounded spirit, and invigorates you for fresh
effort. A beautiful sight it is to see a sea-trout
rise. No half-hearted attempt is his,
but a determined rush for the fly, and down
again like thought, leaving you the tiniest part
of a moment to strike, and hardly time to
admire his beautiful silvery coat. If you have
been fortunate enough to get the steel into
him, you will have time to admire him when
you get him into the boat. Fishing for sea-trout
with the fly is, we consider, the most
exciting of all kinds of fishing&mdash;that is, if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
fish run to a fair average weight. But we are
sorry to say that lochs where it is to be enjoyed
are, with the solitary exception of Loch
Lomond, usually far out of ordinary reach,&mdash;and
in the case of Loch Lomond, it is only
<i>habitu&eacute;s</i> who usually come much speed on it;
but once the angler gets a fair day there, he
finds his way back often. True, there are
some excellent sea-trout lochs in the north,
and on the west coast and islands, but they
are a far cry from civilisation. Nevertheless,
if our readers can spare the time, let them find
their way into some unfrequented spot where
sea-trout are plentiful, and they will agree
with us in thinking that that class of fishing
is a most excellent sport. Some parts of
Ireland are famous for their fine sea-trout
fishing&mdash;white trout they call them there;
and though we have never been there ourselves,
we mean to go some day, when the
Land Bill has pacified the natives, and made
them law-abiding subjects. Meantime one
runs the risk of being mistaken for a non-resident
landlord, and that would be a pity
for one's wife and family. But without any
joking, this Irish sea-trout fishing is a pleasure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to which we look forward; and in this work-a-day
world, something to look forward to is half
the enjoyment of life.</p>

<p>The capture of the <span class="smcapl">SALMON</span> is the ambition
of all anglers, but we doubt very much if the
sport is to compare with ordinary loch or sea-trout
fishing, provided always that the latter
are of good average weight. The tackle used
in salmon-fishing is proportionately heavy, and
after the first few rushes, if the fish be well
hooked, there is little in it except a matter of
time. Indeed it is said that some anglers,
after hooking a salmon, hand the rod to a
gillie to work and land the fish. This seems
going too much in the other direction, but
it is quite understandable. True, the size to
which salmon run is a great inducement to go
after them; but even in Loch Tay, where the
biggest average is to be found, the sport, if
such it can be called at all, is very questionable.
The rod, line, gut, and minnows used
are on such a strong scale, that a well-sized
vessel might be moored with them without
their breaking; and with several scores of
yards of line ready for a rush, what earthly
chance has the fish of escape, unless through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the grossest carelessness? The fish may be
loosely hooked, and get off, but this is quite
a matter of chance, and the odds are that a
hungry spring fish will not miss the lure.
Thus the charm of salmon-fishing is in the
raising and striking; and of all kinds of
striking, the striking of the salmon is the most
difficult: the fish being so large and silvery, the
angler is certain to see him coming <i>at</i> the fly,
and is very apt to strike too soon. But if it is
borne in mind to strike <i>after</i> the broken water
is visible, and not before it, this will soon be
overcome. When you do strike, don't let it
be a mere tightening of the line, as in trout-fishing,
but a decided stroke. Some say that
the salmon will hook himself by his own
weight. This may be so, though we doubt
it,&mdash;but don't trust to it. Certain it is, that
the first rush of a fish does not usually fix
him certain; and should the hook happen to
be in a piece of hard gristle or on a bone, you
will soon find this out for yourself, but generally
at the cost of the fish.</p>

<p>Salmon-fishing is an expensive luxury; but
if you can get it good, never mind the expense,
but give it a trial. If you get good sport, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
may not care to go in for smaller game again;
but in all our experience we never knew a
salmon fisher who did not enjoy trout-fishing
as much in its own way as ever he did that of
the nobler animal. There is something in the
gossamer gut and small flies irresistibly attractive
to all sportsmen, and from which no
amount of salmon-fishing can ever wean them.</p>

<p>The <i>salmo ferox</i> is a fish on which many
opinions have been expressed; and we have
heard more than one old boatman say that he
did not believe it to be anything but a big
loch-trout, as, they ask, Who ever saw a young
one? We see the young of all other fish, but
why do we never come across a young <i>ferox</i>?
It seems pertinent enough questioning, and we
do not pretend to settle their doubts in either
one way or another. Certain it is, he is a big
strong fish with some features distinct from the
ordinary loch trout, and that when caught he
shows an amount of fight not to be equalled
by any of his neighbours, either white or brown.
He is usually caught by trolling either natural
or artificial minnow; and the tackle should be
mounted on gimp and fixed to a strong line,
and plenty of it. We have read of a <i>ferox</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
rising to the fly, but never saw one so captured.
There seems no reason why a gaudy fly should
not attract him. After he is hooked the fun
begins. A <i>ferox</i> of 10 to 12 lb. will give you
amusement and excitement for an indefinite
time; and you are never sure of him till he is
in the boat. A friend of ours (a capital angler
to boot) fishing with us on Loch Assynt in
Sutherlandshire in 1877, hooked a fine specimen;
and after battling with him for an hour,
had the mortification of seeing fish, angel-minnow,
and trace, disappear! A good boatman is a
wonderful help in such a case; indeed without
his help your chances are small. To be sure
it is slow work trolling for <i>feroces</i>, and a whole
day&mdash;yea, days&mdash;may be spent without getting
a run. The angler must always be the best
judge as to whether the chance is worth his
while. Loch Awe, Loch Ericht, Loch Rannoch,
and Loch Assynt, are good lochs for trying
one's luck in this kind of fishing.</p>

<p>Then to come from the nobler to an inferior
species, we get to <span class="smcapl">PIKE</span> fishing. Angling for
this fish seems to be in great repute among
our southern brethren, if we may judge by
the literature on the subject; but somehow or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
other it is looked upon among our northern
anglers with somewhat the same aversion that
a Jew has to bacon, and fishing for pike is
only resorted to when all chance of catching
anything worthier is gone. We don't profess
to say whence this antipathy arises; but we
have heard stories from boatmen about the foul
feeding of pike that makes the idea of eating
him repulsive. Not but that we have eaten
him, but we never did so with relish, however
cunningly the <i>artiste</i> may have served him up.
As a stock for soup he is good; but in Scotland
it is better not to say what the origin of the
stock is till your friends are at their <i>caf&eacute; noir</i>.
But here we are only interested so far as the
sport he gives is concerned; and unless the
pike be all the larger&mdash;say not under 8 lb.&mdash;the
sport is poor enough. Even a pike of 8 lb.
and over, when hooked (which is done by trolling
or casting a minnow and working it after
the manner of a fly), makes one or two long
pulls, not rushes like a fish of the <i>salmo</i> tribe;
and after that he subsides into a sulk from
which you must trust to the strength of your
tackle to arouse him. The tackle should be
mounted on gimp, for his teeth are very sharp;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and when removing the lure from his mouth,
you will find it much safer to have previously
put the foot-spar between his jaws to prevent
him getting at your fingers.</p>

<p>There is a fly, if such it can be called, used
in pike-fishing. This fly resembles a natural insect
as much as a tea-pot resembles an elephant,
but it does attract pike&mdash;in the same way, we
suppose, that a piece of red flannel will attract
a mackerel. If our readers wish to try it, they
can buy it at almost any tackle shop. Pike
are to be found in almost all lochs, though in
the more frequented of our Scotch waters they
are being slowly but surely exterminated. In
others, again, they reign almost alone. But
pike-fishing by itself is a poor affair, and we
advise our readers only to take to it when they
can do nought better. If any of them wish to
go below the level of pike-fishing, we must
refer them to the copious instructions of many
books, from Isaak Walton downwards. For
ourselves, when it comes to bait-fishing&mdash;except
in running water, when worm-fishing is
an art&mdash;we prefer catching whitings and haddocks
in some of our beautiful salt-water lochs,
to all the perch, roach, chub, and such-like,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that ever swam. But in this please note that
we are only expressing our own opinion, and
with all respect to the opinions of many
worthy anglers. We may say this, however,
with all safety, that in angling, as in most
other things, if one aims at the highest point
of the art he is not at all likely to condescend
to the lowest.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<small>AFTER A DAY'S FISHING.</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">What</span> a pleasant fatigue succeeds a day's
fishing! There is not, or should not be,
a feeling of weariness, but just the satisfaction
one feels after enjoying a health-giving recreation.
Health-giving it certainly is to the body,
and we have no hesitation in saying to the
mind also. It makes one forget for the time
being all the evils to which flesh is heir, and
braces up the whole system to meet them
when the necessity arises. But we must not
go in for more sentiment than is actually needful.
The practical duties after a day's fishing
are these. If the weather has been damp,
change all wet garments <i>at once</i>, and if at all
practicable have a hot bath before sitting
down to dinner. We say dinner advisedly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
for the angler should always have a good
sound dinner after a day's fishing, as however
pleasant the work may have been, still it
is exhausting to the body, and a rough tea,
though good in itself, cannot pretend to have
the reviving elements in it that a substantial
dinner has. A glass of whisky, or even two,
in cold water, will be found a very safe accompaniment.
A good plan is to order your
whisky by the bottle, and put your card in a
nick made in the cork: the ordering of whisky
in glasses is expensive and unsatisfactory.
Your dinner over, turn your attention to your
tackle. Unwind your lines, so far as they
have been wet, from the reels, and lay them
out on your bedroom floor; if any chance of
being interfered with, wind them round the
backs of chairs instead. They will be dry by
the morning. Dry your reels thoroughly, and
put in a little oil wherever you think they
would be the better of it; and this should be
done to any other article&mdash;spring-balance, gaff,
&amp;c.&mdash;that is liable to rust. Your creel or fishing-bag
should be washed out and hung up to
dry by the servants of the house immediately
after the fish have been removed, which latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
should be done without delay. Your landing-net
should also be suspended in the open air,
that it may get dry as speedily as possible. A
landing-net will last double the time if attention
is given to it in this way. Take out all
used casting-lines from your book, and lay
them on the mantelpiece till morning: this
will insure the feathers being freed from moisture.
And in the case of expensive flies, this is
a matter of consideration, both on the point of
expense as well as your possible inability to
replace them where you may happen to be
sojourning for the time. If you mean to make
up a new cast or casts for the morrow, place
the casting-lines in a little water in your basin.
They will be in excellent order next morning
for manipulation. Also soak in like manner
the <i>gut</i> on which the flies which you mean to
use are dressed. True, you may not be sure
what flies you will put on till you see what
sort of a day it may prove to be, but there is
no harm done if you soak the gut (but only
the gut) of as many flies as will give you a
good choice.</p>

<p>We should have said nearer the beginning
of this chapter to look well after your waterproofs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
that they are not hung up in a hot
place. A dry room or outhouse where there is
a good draught is best. If your fishing should
happen to be over for the time being, put your
tackle past (after being thoroughly dried) in
the most orderly fashion possible. For our
own part, we have the drawer in our bookcase
spaced out into compartments suitable for
holding all our tackle, barring reels and such
like; and this arrangement we find extremely
useful, and wonderfully convenient when we
wish to find anything. If, on the other hand,
you are out on a lengthy holiday, and have
time at your disposal, after putting things right
for the day, and for next day too, we know of
nothing better than a <i>good</i> rubber at whist for
filling up the evening. It must be a <i>good</i>
rubber, however, for the parlour game is neither
relaxation nor pleasure. Hence we would
advise all our angling friends to acquire a
thorough knowledge of the game, as only to
be learned with the aid of a good book on
the subject. Remember that when staying
at some out-of-the-way fishing hotel, you
may be asked to form a table with good
players, and not to be able to hold your own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
on such occasions is a great loss of pleasure
to yourself, and usually a source of annoyance
to the others. These remarks are somewhat
apart from the subject of this book, but by
way of an aside, they may be found not quite
out of place.</p>

<p>Do not be beguiled into keeping late hours,
for no one can fish well next day if he has not
had a sufficient amount of sleep. But this is
also an aside; for some men need more sleep
than others, and each angler knows his own
necessities best. We only promulgate the
broad rule, that without proper rest no one
can be in good trim with hand and eye for a
pastime that needs both in a pre-eminent degree.
We speak from experience in this too;
and have sometimes imagined that our right
hand had lost its cunning till we remembered
that we had not been properly rested the night
before.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<small>REMINISCENCES.</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Having</span> exhausted, so far as we can imagine,
the practical part of our little treatise,
we proceed&mdash;in accordance with an idea
which we had in our minds at starting&mdash;to
give a few personal recollections, and to name
one or two lochs where we have enjoyed good
sport, and where it is still to be had for the
trouble of going. Reminiscences are, as a rule,
not specially interesting to the general reader,
hence we shall not make them too lengthy;
for we wish, above all things, that our readers
shall close this volume without experiencing
a shadow of weariness. One thing, however,
we would like to say to our younger angling
friends&mdash;Have as many personal adventures to
look back to as you possibly can. The adventures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
themselves can be best sought after when
the blood flows fast; for the time will come
when the rod and the tackle will perforce have
to be laid aside, and memory will then, unaided,
afford you many a pleasant retrospect, and you
will&mdash;even companionless&mdash;fight your battles
over again. You remember the story of the
illustrious Prince Talleyrand: when a young
man acknowledged to him that he could not
play whist, Talleyrand said to him&mdash;"Young
man, what a sad old age you are preparing for
yourself!" We don't mean to go this length
as regards fishing; but we safely say that a
man who lives to old age without having been
a keen angler, has not only deprived himself
of great enjoyments during his active life, but
has neglected to lay up a provision for the time
when the memory of them would have made
life's closing seasons sweeter.</p>

<p>Our first acquaintance with <span class="smcap">Loch Ard</span> was
very pleasant&mdash;not, perhaps, so much from any
great expectation of sport, because at that time
(many years ago now) we were young at the pastime,
but more from the feeling of treading the
ground made classical by the great Magician of
the North, as the scene of the most stirring incidents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in 'Rob Roy.' Attached to a big tree
in front of the hotel at Aberfoyle there hangs
a coulter, which tradition assigns as the veritable
article which Bailie Nicol Jarvie made
red-hot and used as a weapon of offence and
defence when he was in a dilemma in what
was, at that time, a very inaccessible part of
the Highlands. Since then many a Glasgow
magistrate has visited the spot&mdash;the inspection
of the line of the noble waterworks undertaking
which supplies the city being a sufficient
excuse for the annual advent of the civic rulers.
A railway station (Bucklyvie) is within eight
miles of Aberfoyle, and Aberfoyle is within
three miles of Loch Ard, and by the time this
book is in the hand of the reader there will
most likely be a railway station at Aberfoyle
itself. Shade of Bailie Nicol Jarvie! what would
you say if you were now to be allowed to haunt
the old spot? to hear a locomotive screech
where formerly you thought yourself so far
"frae the Sautmarket o' Glesca"? We don't
like the idea ourselves, and doubt very much
if it will pay. However, it is the fishing alone
which concerns us meantime, and we can at once
assure our angling friends that the sport is good&mdash;not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
but what one has to fish hard for a basket;
but the same remark applies to all our near-at-hand
lochs. On an ordinary good day a dozen
to eighteen trout may be captured, and sometimes
the baskets are heavier; but eighteen
fish, weighing 9 lb. to 12 lb., is a very fair day's
work. The trout average fairly a half pound,
and pounders are by no means scarce: a two-pounder
is come across occasionally, but he is
the exception. The fish are very pretty, and
for their size give excellent sport. Fine tackle
is here absolutely essential to success, and as
a matter of sport should always be used in
fishing for common yellow trout. The loch,
for its size, is much fished; and we fear that
when the railway facilities are completed, there
will require to be a considerable amount of restocking
to keep it up to the old mark. The
scenery is unsurpassed&mdash;wood, water, and mountain,
making a picture of wondrous beauty. To
the north of the loch, Ben Lomond rears its
mighty summit; and in the spring-time (for
Loch Ard is an early loch), before the summer
sun has melted the winter's snow, the effect is
grand in the extreme. April, May, and June,
are supposed to be the best months for angling;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
but we see no reason why, if the weather be
favourable, these months should be singled out.
The hotel accommodation at Aberfoyle is excellent.
In the early months you must engage
a boat beforehand: boatmen first-rate. Many
a happy day we have spent on Loch Ard&mdash;sometimes
successful and sometimes much the
reverse; but in any case there is a witchery
about the place that makes one enjoy himself
in spite of all cares. Mind and body recruit
their jaded energies, and get braced up to meet
the stern realities of life.</p>

<p>In strong contradistinction, in this respect,
to Loch Ard, is <span class="smcap">Loch Leven</span>. In the latter, if
the angler is not catching fish, there is little of
the beautiful to commend itself to the senses.
The island on which the castle stands is pretty,
and as a historic ruin is well worthy of a visit,
but otherwise the scenery is very tame, and the
surroundings not entrancing. But since we
have drifted into speaking of Loch Leven, we
may as well tell of the sport which is to be had
there,&mdash;and this, as is well known, is exceptionally
good. The quality of the fish is wonderful;
and after reading the statistics of a year's
fishing&mdash;last season something like 18,000 fish,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
weighing as many pounds, were killed&mdash;one is
puzzled to know how it is kept up. The loch
itself is a great natural feeding-pond, miles and
miles of it being of an almost uniform depth,
and a boat may drift almost anywhere, the
angler feeling at the same time certain that
fish are in his immediate vicinity. Trout of
two and three pounds are quite common; and
it is a rare occasion that a day's average does
not come up to the pound for each fish. They
are very fine eating, and cut red as a grilse.
The company which rents the loch pay &pound;800
to &pound;1000 for the fishing, and they in turn keep
a fleet of large boats&mdash;twenty we think&mdash;and
let them out to anglers at the rate of 2s. 6d.
an hour. Any number may fish from one boat.
There are two boatmen in each boat,&mdash;one of
whom is paid by the company, the other by
the angler; and we are sorry to say that these
men, with a few exceptions, are very much
spoiled. There is a class of anglers(?) who
frequent Loch Leven, whose whole aim seems
to be, not sport so far as their own personal
efforts are concerned, but the killing of as many
fish as possible. If such a one has engaged a
boat, he arms each boatman with a rod, and, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
course, fishes himself, thus having three rods
going at once. As we said before, the loch can
be drifted without any attention from the men,
after they have pulled up to the wind, and this
enables them to get casting all the time that
their employer is doing likewise. Not content
with this, a couple of minnows are generally
trolled astern when changing ground. We don't
say that a man has not a right to do as he
likes if he pays for his boat; but we <i>do</i> ask,
Is this sport? And why should boatmen be
spoiled in this way to such an extent that we
have known them sulk a whole day because a
spare rod was not allowed to be put up for
their special benefit? But, of course, the men
are just as they have been made, and true
anglers, who fish for a day's sport, and not for
the mere sake of slaughter, have the remedy in
their own hands. Don't let anything deter you
from fishing Loch Leven. It may be expensive;
but if you get a good, or even a fair day,
you will not regret the expense. Get a friend
to join you, and the expense is not so heavy
after all; and if your friend and yourself fish
perseveringly all day, you will usually be rewarded
with a very fine show of fish. There is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
no harm in letting your men fish when you are
taking your lunch, <i>but don't allow a third rod
to be put up</i>. The boatmen are, as a rule, only
fifth-rate fishers, though, of course, a few of
them handle a rod well. Our recollections of
Loch Leven are pleasant in some ways, in
others they are not; but don't fail to give it a
trial, if only for the pleasure of handling a big
fish on fine gut. The manager of the Loch
Leven fishings, Captain Hall, fills a very difficult
post with much acceptance to all concerned.</p>

<p>But to leave the Lowlands and go into the
far North, we take you to <span class="smcap">Loch Assynt</span>, in
Sutherlandshire, and to a little loch near it,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Loch
Awe</span> by name. The journey to Assynt
is long and weary: train to Lairg, and then
between thirty and forty miles driving, is a
good long scamper for fishing, but it is worth
it. The inn at Inchnadamph is good, but when
we were there in 1877 the boat accommodation
was poor enough: perhaps they have improved
upon that since. The first day after our arrival
we had to go to Loch Awe, as the boats on the
large loch (Assynt) were taken up. Such a
morning of rain and wind! We were wet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
through our waterproofs during the four-mile
drive, but luckily the weather moderated, and
we had an excellent day's fishing. With two
in the boat, we took 57 lb. weight of beautiful
fish,&mdash;not large, but very game, and spotted
intensely red. It must have been a good day,
for many an angler tried his luck after our success,
but never came near that mark, at least
when we were there. Loch Assynt is more
attractive, however, inasmuch as the chances
of big fish are not remote. Trout of a pound
weight, and over, are not uncommon, while the
chance of a grilse adds excitement to the sport.
Then <i>ferox</i>, as we have said in a previous chapter,
are, comparatively speaking, not scarce, if
one cares to go in for trolling for them. But,
in any case, the angler is always sure of a
basket of lovely yellow trout. On the hills
behind the inn there is a small loch, called the
<span class="smcap">Mulach-Corrie</span>, in which it is said that the
gillaroo trout are to be found. Whether they
are the real trout of that species or not, we
cannot say, but certainly they are beautiful
fish,&mdash;pink in the scales, and running to large
sizes. We saw a basket taken by a friend, and
it was a treat to look at. The fish were all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
taken with the fly, but we were told afterwards
that worm is even deadlier than fly, and that
one should never go there without a supply of
"wrigglers." The hill between the inn and the
Mulach-Corrie is a perfect paradise for fern-gatherers.
It is said that about two dozen different
kinds can be gathered; and we believe it,
for even our untutored eyes discerned sixteen
varieties! Our visit to Inchnadamph must be
placed among the red-letter periods of our fishing
life, and to be looked back to with much
enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loch Morar</span>, in Inverness-shire, is another
delightful spot, and somewhat out of the usual
track. The fishing is most excellent, and yellow
trout of all sizes are very abundant. Sea-trout
and salmon find their way frequently into
the angler's basket; and half-way up the loch,
which is a long one, at a bay into which the
Meoble river flows, numbers of sea-fish are to
be found. The best way is to fly-fish up to
that bay one day, and seek shelter at night in
some shepherd's cottage, thus being at hand to
prosecute salmon and sea-trout fishing the next
day, or days, if you find the sport good. It is
right to take a supply of provisions and liquor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
with you, for the accommodation is humble. We
write this from hearsay, as when we were there
in mid-July salmon and sea-trout were not
in the loch in large numbers; but still we
caught some of the latter, and hooked, though,
unfortunately, did not kill, any of the former.
We should think that the beginning of August
would be the best time for this loch as regards
sea-fish; but the trout-fishing in July is unsurpassable.
During our sojourn in 1876 at Arisaig,
the nearest village to the loch, which is six
miles off, and necessitating a drive over what
was then a road sadly in need of General
Wade's good offices, we had the services of a
boatman, Angus by name, and his two boys,
who could not speak a word of English,&mdash;Angus
managing one boat, and his boys the
other. We had the satisfaction&mdash;for indeed it
was good fun&mdash;to be out with the boys one
day; and the management of the boat had to be
done by signals. It was wonderful how readily
the boys got into the way of it, and how well
we got on together. The memory of the hospitality
which we enjoyed at Arisaig Inn will not
be forgotten by any of our party; and we hope
that the then occupier, Mr Routledge, will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
there when we go back again. An inn was in
course of being built at the loch-side in 1876,
but we do not know how it has succeeded. The
easiest way to Arisaig is by steamer, which
usually goes once a-week; but the angler
should, if possible, go to Banavie or Fort-William,&mdash;the
latter for choice, as Banavie
Hotel is famous for long bills (and we can
testify that its notoriety in this respect is
deserved),&mdash;and then drive to Arisaig. It is
about thirty-eight miles from Fort-William to
Arisaig, but the drive is something to be remembered
during a lifetime. After having
traversed this road, you will say, "There's no
place like home" for grand and beautiful scenery.
We must see Loch Morar again if we
possibly can, before we bequeath our tackle to
the next generation.</p>

<p>The time would fail us to tell of many other
lochs, more or less famous for the good sport
they afford; but the angler, if at all of an enterprising
nature, need have little hesitation in
taking up Mr Lyall's excellent 'Sportsman's
Guide,' and making a selection on his own
account. The information is very correct so far
as we have tried it, sometimes&mdash;perhaps most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
anglers are inclined that way&mdash;erring a little
to the <i>couleur de rose</i> side of things, but quite
trustworthy in being followed as a suggester
for a fortnight's fishing. We have gained much
pleasure in exploring some of our more remote
lochs, of the existence of which we might
never have been aware but for its information.
We cannot, however, close this long, but we
hope not wearisome, chapter without singing
the praises of our Queen of Scottish Lakes, <span class="smcap">Loch
Lomond</span>. The scenery of this beautiful spot
is well known in some ways, but no amount
of travelling in a steamer will reveal its
beauties. To the tourist we would say, take
a small boat at Luss and engage a man to row
you among the islands which lie between Luss
and Balmaha. With this hint to the tourist,
we leave him, and turn the angler's attention
to the sport&mdash;very precarious at most times,
but excellent at others&mdash;to be had on Loch
Lomond. Luss is the angling centre, and there
are capital boats and men to be had by writing
beforehand to the hotel-keeper, Mr M'Nab,
who deserves much credit for the attention
he pays to the wants of anglers.</p>

<p>The yellow-trout fishing is good, but, strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to say, this class of sport is not much sought
after. In April and May as good trout-fishing
is to be had as on some other lochs that
enjoy a greater reputation. But if the weather
has been at all favourable to the fish running,
the month of June sees the sea-trout fishing
fairly commenced. It is a hard loch to fish;
and if you are lucky enough to get two or
three sea-trout in a day, consider yourself
fortunate. They are a good average&mdash;2 lb. to
3 lb. being quite common&mdash;but they spread
themselves so much over a large portion of
water that one may fish a whole day and not
come across them. This, however, is the exception,
as in an ordinary fair fishing day in
June, July, August, and September, and even
October if the weather is mild, they are almost
certain to be seen, if not caught. Some days
really good sport is to be had&mdash;indeed, one is
surprised at the show of fish; but fish or no
fish, the charm of Loch Lomond is everlasting.
The angler finds his way back over and over
again, till, as in our own experience, the islands
of Lonaig, Moan, Cruin, Fad, and last and least,
Darroch, the great landing-spot, are as familiar
to him as his daily business haunts. Then the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
chances of a salmon are good&mdash;indeed, this
year (1881) a great many have been killed; but
somehow or another the sea-trout fishing has
not been so good, and though a salmon is
always a salmon, we would rather see a good
show of sea-trout at any time. Like our
neighbours, we have had good and bad days
on Loch Lomond; but disappointment has
never soured us&mdash;indeed, the fascination seems
to get stronger. And it is so very convenient
for a day's fishing&mdash;down in the morning and
home at night, with a good long day between.
The charge for boatman is 5s. to 6s. and lunch;
and though this seems high, it must not be
forgotten that the distances are great. A boat
costs 2s. per day. The men are good all over,
some of them really first-rate. Many and
many a story we could tell of happy fishing
days, and of days most enjoyably spent when
fishing was no go; but mostly every angler can
do the same, and we don't wish to become too
tiresome. Perhaps if we get the chance we
may extend this chapter on some future occasion,
and add some experiences of as yet untried
places.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<small>CONCLUSION.</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Brother</span> of the gentle art, we bid you farewell!
We have done our best to give
you the benefit of our experience in the peaceful
pursuit of loch-fishing; and if we have
said too much or too little, pray excuse us, and
in your goodness of heart reprove us for our
verbosity, and tell us what is awanting. The
spirit on our part has been very willing; but
the memory may have been defective when it
should have been most active, and quite possibly
our love for the art may have somewhere
or another led us into discursiveness where we
should have been brief. We are all human,
and he is a poor mortal who thinks he cannot
err. Again we say farewell!&mdash;not for long,
however, we hope. Who knows where we may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
meet? If we do, and you recognise us, don't
forget to give us a little encouragement, and,
if you can, new material for extending the usefulness
of this publication. As we write, the
hand of winter is upon us, and the rod and
reel have been relegated to safe quarters; but
spring will return, and the enforced cessation
of our enjoyment will only add new zest to
the music of the reel</p>

<p><small>"In the present delightful volumes, however, he presents all
lovers of Scotland with the completest details of every Highland

knowledge of their own river or 'water' which no books can
teach, and which Mr Colquhoun himself would equally have to
learn. But no chapter ought to be skipped, even by a reader
who aspires to far less than the fourfold distinction of a Highland
